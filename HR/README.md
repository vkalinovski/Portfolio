# HR Analytics

## Project Description

The HR analytics project for the company ‚ÄúWork with Care‚Äù is aimed at optimizing personnel management using machine learning. Analysts examine employee data, including satisfaction levels obtained from survey questionnaires. The goal of the project is to build two models: one to predict an employee‚Äôs satisfaction level based on client data, and another to predict the likelihood of employee turnover.

## Conclusion

Data analysis showed that employees who left had an average workload, more often worked in the procurement department, and had a low salary. These factors collectively lowered their satisfaction and led to their departure. Recommendations include increasing salaries for categories with medium and high workloads, as well as fostering more supportive management practices to improve satisfaction and reduce employee attrition.
