## Project Description

The aim of the research is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of All-Russian survey data to gain a deeper understanding of the structure and dynamics of civil society in Russia. The main areas of analysis include: demographics, respondent clustering, study of awareness of non-profit organizations (NGOs), and prediction of missing responses regarding the role of religion in life.

<div style="border:solid Chocolate 2px; padding: 40px">

<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">1Ô∏è‚É£ Demographic Analysis</h2>  

**Key findings from the demographic analysis:**

- The largest groups of respondents live in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, the Republic of Dagestan, Stavropol Krai, and the Rostov Region. This indicates a wide geographic spread and diversity of regions.  
- Respondents from Stavropol Krai were older than the rest: the median age of women was 50 years, and men was 47 years.  
- There were more women in the survey, which may indicate their greater engagement and activity.  
- The most common level of education was vocational secondary, while only a few had completed postgraduate studies.

<h3 style="color:#008080;">üîç Conclusions</h3>  
The demographics showed regional diversity, a predominance of vocational secondary education, and older age groups in certain areas. This information will assist in planning further research and communication strategies.

<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">2Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering of Respondents</h2>  
Clustering divided respondents into three groups with different readiness for collective action:

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üïê Cluster 1: Willingness to Collaborate</h4>  
This group includes respondents who are willing to engage in joint actions but face many disagreements in the external environment.

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üïë Cluster 2: Prevalence of Agreement</h4>  
Respondents in this cluster live in a more harmonious environment and are also ready to join together for actions.

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üïí Cluster 3: Agreement Without Initiative</h4>  
People in this cluster live in a cooperative environment but do not show active readiness for joint initiatives.

<h3 style="color:#008080;">üîç Conclusions</h3>  
The analysis showed that most respondents are oriented toward cooperation, a substantial portion are proactive, and the remaining are inclined toward passive agreement. This is important when developing engagement strategies for different groups.

<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">3Ô∏è‚É£ Awareness of Organizations</h2>

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üß† Awareness of Various NGOs</h4>  
- Gardening associations and trade unions are known to almost half of participants in the survey‚Äîhighlighting the role of social connections and interest in social rights.  
- Associations of people with disabilities and political parties are mentioned by about one-third of respondents.  
- Almost half of respondents learn about NGOs from acquaintances, emphasizing the importance of word-of-mouth.  
- About a quarter of respondents get information from the internet, media, and outdoor advertising, reflecting the importance of digital channels.

<h3 style="color:#008080;">üîç Conclusions</h3>  
High awareness and the role of personal contacts underscore the need to combine offline and online channels to effectively disseminate information about NGOs.

<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">4Ô∏è‚É£ Alignment of Preferences in Volunteer Activities</h2>

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üìä Alignment of Respondents' Preferences</h4>  
The greatest alignment was found between support for cultural and environmental initiatives, as well as between different types of charity organizations and community associations.

<h3 style="color:#008080;">üîç Conclusions</h3>  
Cultural and environmental organizations can expect a wide response, and the connection between charity and sports associations opens new points of interaction.

<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">5Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction of Missing Responses on the Role of Religion</h2>

<h4 style="color:#4682b4;">üîÆ Machine Learning Results</h4>  
- The best model was the CatBoostClassifier, showing the highest accuracy in predicting responses about the significance of religion in respondents' lives.

<h3 style="color:#008080;">üîç Conclusions</h3>  
The model made it possible to assess the importance of religion for those who skipped the question, providing a reliable picture of the distribution of views in the sample.

<h1 style="color:#008080;">ü¶Ñ Final Conclusion</h1>
</center>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
The study revealed the geographic, age, and educational diversity of respondents, identified social clusters with varying levels of readiness for cooperation, demonstrated channels of awareness of NGOs, and confirmed the interconnection of preferences in volunteer activities. The machine learning model successfully predicted missing responses about religion, complementing the overall picture.
