# Taxi Demand Forecasting üöï

## Project Description
The company ‚ÄúChtenkoe Taxi‚Äù collected historical data on taxi orders at airports and aims to attract more drivers during peak demand periods. To achieve this, it is necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour. We built a model for this prediction, ensuring an RMSE on the test set of no more than 48.

## Conclusion
Overall, all models showed similar performance, but the best model was LinearRegression. The model predicts demand well, capturing accurate peaks and troughs on the graph.
